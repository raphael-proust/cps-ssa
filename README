%Studying the relation between SSA and CPS


#End

We want to see what the SSA based optimisations do on CPS (and maybe later ANF).


#Mean

We use an SSA to CPS translator and feed it LLVM assembly files. Here is what
the program does:


~~~~~~~
                     +>file.opt.ll --> LLVM --> SSA --> CPS
                     |                                   |
                    opt                                  |
                     |                                   |
file.c --clang--> file.ll --> LLVM --> SSA --> CPS       |
                                                |        |

                                                |        |
                                                v        v
                                           file.cps   file.opt.cps
                                                |        |
                                                +--diff--+
                                                    |
                                                    v
                                                   ????
                                                    |
                                                    v
                                                  PROFIT
~~~~~~~

Note that we can also use Haskell (`.hs`) files and feed them to ghc to get llvm
(`.ll`) files.
