Studying the relation between SSA and CPS (and ANF when appropriate).

Most representations and algorithms are from litterature. Here is a
non-exhaustive list of papers that were used:

- A Functional Perspective on SSA Optimisation Algorithms;
  Chakravarty, Keller and Zadarnowski.
- SSA is Functional Programming;  Appel.
- Efficiently Computing Static Single Assignment Form and The Control Dependence
  Graph;  Cytron, Ferrante, Rosen, Wegman and Zadeck
- Compiling Standard ML to Java Bytecodes;  Benton, Kennedy and Russell.
- Compiling with Continuations, Continued;  Kennedy.
- Design and Implementation of Code Optimizations for a Type-Directed Compiler
  for Standard ML;  Tarditi.
- Separating Stages in the CPS Transformation;  Lawall and Danvy.
- Optimizing Nested Loops Using Local CPS Conversion;  Reppy.
- A Generic Account of Continuation Passing Styles;  Hatcliff, Danvy.
- Contification Using Dominators;  Fluet and Weeks.
- Global Value Numbers and Redundant Computations;  Rosen, Wegman and Zadeck.
- A Correspondence between Continuation Passing Style and Static Single
  Assignment Form;  Kelsey.
