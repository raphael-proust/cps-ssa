This is an adaptation of Daan Leijen's [PPrint] library, which itself is based
on the ideas developed by Philip Wadler in ``A Prettier Printer''.  For more

The present code was written by Fran√ßois Pottier and Nicolas Pouillard. It is
in a somewhat rough state: although the internals of the renderer are rather
well documented, the combinators for building documents could be tidied up and
better explained. The code is provided as is.
